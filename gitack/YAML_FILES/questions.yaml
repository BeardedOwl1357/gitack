        description: |
          - Writing junits ensures that code gets tested in local
          - Also, the coverage of code must be similar to develop
          - Try to deliver junit in same branch as feature branch

        question: "If you have any SQL changes, are they idempotent?"
        description: | 
          - To test idempotent processes, deploy first.

        question: "Have you tested your changes on testing cluster? (DP/INF)"
        description: |
          - Before the code is merged in develop, you must test in testing cluster to ensure no unexpected issues arise. 
          - Minikube environment can lead to faulty results

        question: "Have you tested flyway changes on fresh deployment?"
        description: |
          - This allows us to test scenario for new clusters. 
            - For example, if we were to create a new OKE cluster, the deployment will happen from scratch
            - We must ensure that we are not generating any issues
          - To test, execute the following commands
          ```bash
          ./undeploy.sh ;

          - To test this
            - Create sample data for each portlet (edge might be an exception. Or just use a DB link)
            - Open UI and check for both ECPAdmin and GBUAdmin

        description: |
          - To test this
            - Redeploy cicd. Onboard a tenant and deploy monitoring service
            - Onboard a new tenant and check functionality
